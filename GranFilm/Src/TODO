The Most Important:

* Fix the calculation of the Integrals
   - several of the integrals are not needed
   - sharing of varibale with the integran not clear enough

* There seems to be a weak dependece on the Multipole_Position_Ratio
   - is this an error or a numerical artifact?
   - difference due to a higher order effect?
     


--------------------------------------------------------

* Correct the convertion between wavelength and Energy
   - currently it is  hardcoded constant

* Clean up the linear_Algebra_Module
   - in particular the Solve_Linear_System routine

* Clean up the Integral module
   - it seems to work as it is now, but still needs to be cleaned
   - Also the Q-integrals are calculated when not neede
   - Also the m=1 integrals when the upper limit is ONE are not
   - Cirrently they are calculated...... creating an unneeded overhead   

* Fix the problem in the  List_Supported_Options routine
   - the call to the error_warning routine seems not to work....

* Set the default output unit to StdOut in SFL_Error_Handling....
   - this should already have been done in the GranFilm version....

* Should one transfer the Integrals and Results derived type variables
   - Currently these variables are shaered

* Can we make the code so that the direction of the z-axis can be chosen?
   - It seems to me that these are the chnages :
   -      of sign of the suseptebilities
   -      the limits of integration so that tr_r -> - t_r   

* Check how the angles of incidence are defined. 
   - it it according to the positive z-direction or not.....
   - does the this choice matter for the incident field?
   - in Leif's version there is somthing regarding (theta0_calc)
   - see def of theta0_calc. in initialize_mod.f90 in the old code!  

* Start using param%Source%iambient etc for the incident medium
   - Do not hardcode the medium to be 1 and 2 etc.

* What is happening when |x|=1 in finction Legendre_Plm_Diff
   - there seems to be a singularity....
   
* What if Chi is zero, so that the argument of the integran is NaN
   - this seems to happen when t_r=0.5; z_mp=0, Radius = 8.
   - fix this!!!!  
   - Can one use QAGP or QAWS?

* For the itegration, should one try out the new integrators
   - try  QAWO designed for oscillating interators

* Give equation reference to what is implemented in susceptibility
   - this applies in particular to the dipole interaction case

   
* In GUI mode write out the the values of epsilon for all media of the system.
  Is this the right way to do it?
