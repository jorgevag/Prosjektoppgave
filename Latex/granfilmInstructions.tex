\section{Introduction to GranFilm}
This section is included as a brief summary of the practical situations one encounter
when using GranFilm. Even though the software provides the information required and would be
self-explanatory for some, this would be for the less experienced reader to avoid any unecessary 
confusion.

\subsection{Software overview}
\textsc{GranFilm} is a program written in \textsc{Fortran 90} and serves as a tool for simulating 
and interpreting optical spectra from surfaces or thin films. The program takes in parameters specifying
the incoming angle, polarization and energy range of the incoming plane wave, in addition to the
radius and truncation ratio $t_r$ of the sphere, the materials for region 1,2,3 and 4,
the arrangement of the islands and finally the multipole order $M$.
