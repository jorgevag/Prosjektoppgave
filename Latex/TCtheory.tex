\section{\textbf{Smart windows and thermochromism}}
\subsection{Smart/intelligent windows}
%Smart windows (or intelligent windows) are defined as a type of window that partially blocks the
%solar radiation in hot weather and transmitts the solar radiation in cold weather by changing its
%thermal and radiative properties (dynamically) (\cite{Kamalisarvestani2013}:(25)). 
A smart window or intelligent window is a type of window that manages to 
regulate the transmitted solar radiation by changing its optical properties.
The change in the optical properties can be
obtained by adding a controllable absorbing layer on the surface of the glass. 
The resulting ability of the smart window to 
control the transmittance of%optimize
solar flux and daylight, may help to
reduce the electricity consumption regarding heating, cooling and lighting.
%The use of smart windows may help to reduce heating, cooling and electricity loads in buildings.
They should optimally also be able to adapt to the differences created by the seasons. E.g. summertimes
have a different demand than wintertimes with respect to the thermal properties of the window. In
summertimes the ambient temperature is around or above the comfortable region and the window should
therefore possess high reflectance in the infrared region to prevent further increase in temperature. 
In wintertimes on the other hand, the temperature is below the comfortable level and the reflectance 
should be low in order to allow the sun to heat up the indoor climate. This in addition to the
transmission of light in the visible region, may reduce or remove the need for electrical heating, cooling
or lighting such as HVAC devices or light bulbs.

Windows with such a
switchable layer can be categorized into two systems: active and passive. 
%The active switchable glazing systems require an external triggering mechanism and offers supplementary
%options compared to passive systems. An example of this is the electrochromic window. 
%However, their dependency on a power supply and additional 
%electronical curcuits makes them not as attractive as their passive counterparts.  
The active systems may be for example a switchable glazing with the opportunity to switch from 
one set of optical properties to another. An example of this is a electrochromic window, which
uses a burst of electricity from an external energy source in order to change the opacity of the material.
%
The passive devices on the other hand, do not require an external energy source, but switches automatically
subject to environmental change. Examples of such devices are: photochromic windows, which reacts to 
light and thermochromic windows, which change in accordance to the temperature
\cite{Kamalisarvestani2013, Baetens2010}. The latter materal will be discussed in more detail
in the following section.

   \caption{Comparison of the electric lighting energy and cooling energy consumption between different
      glazing types. Adapted from \cite[p.~20]{Huovila2007}. For example, reflective glass reflects
      a large portion of the incident radiation, both visual light and radiant heat. This leaves it
      as a good option for hot climates where it can reduce the cooling load of the building. However,
      due to the low transmission of light additional lighting is required lowering the energy
      benefit to some extent.
   }
   \label{fig:energyComparison}
\end{figure}
%
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:energyComparison} the resulting energy consumption varies for the different
window and glazing technologies. 
It also demonstrates an important fact: even though using reflective glass would reduce
cooling loads, a window should also be able to let visible light through. If the transmission of
the visible spectrum is to low, it could cause the need for additional lighting, which again
would increase the overall energy load \cite{Correa2004}.
%\textbf{EXTRA:} Due to lighting, a window should be able to let through visible light (\cite{Kamalisarvestani2013},12).
Electrochromic and thermochromic windows usually
result in lower cooling loads. In addition the electrochromic technology requires 
less energy for lighting due to the thermochromic coatings low optical transmission.
%However, as argued in the review of Kamalisarvestani et al.
%\cite{Kamalisarvestani2013}, the necessity of electrical wires for electrochromic windows and
%that the visible transmission of thermochromic windows can be
%increased by appropriate doping \cite[p.~39]{Kanu2010}(70), 
%ensures the position of thermochromic windows as a good and low-priced alternative \cite{Mlyuka2009}
%\textbf{<-fikk ikke tilgang,prøv VPN}.
However, 
%as argued in the review of Kamalisarvestani et al.\cite{Kamalisarvestani2013}, 
this is not enough to exclude thermochromic layers
as they serve as a good and low-priced alternative to the electrochromical ones \cite{Mlyuka2009}.
For instance, a thermochromic window does not need any 
elecrical wires as its electrochromic counterpart and the low visible transmission of the
thermochromic windows can be increased by adding small quantities of a foreign material 
into the thermochromic coating. The process of adding small quantities of another element 
into a material is called doping and leads to changes in the electrical and optical properties 
\cite[p.~39]{Kanu2010}. 
%appropriate doping \cite[p.~39]{Kanu2010}(70). 
%Doping is the act of introducing a foreign element into a material to change its electrical or
%optical properties. This will be discussed further in Section \ref{sec:vo2}.




\subsection{Thermochromic materials}
%Materials that change their optical nature when subject to irradiation by light(photons),
%temperature change or an applied electric field are called photochromic, thermochromic and 
%electrochromic, respectively, and are collectively called chromic materials.
%(\cite{Kiri2010},1)
%\\
%\\
%The word thermochromic originates from Greek, meaning warm or hot (''Thermos'') and color (''Chroma'').
%As mentioned earlier, thermochromic materials their optical properties in response to changes in
%temperature and results in the material changing color (\cite{Kamalisarvestani2013},74,75). 
%
The technology behind intelligent windows and its diversity, is based on
materials that change their optical properties when subjected to some external physical process.
These materials are called chromic materials. 
The word chromic originates from the greek word ''Chroma'', which means color.
If the induced change of optical properties results in changing the spectral reflectance in
the visible spectrum, the material will change its color. 
%\textit{?CAN I SAY THIS WITHOUT A REFERENCE? ISN*T IT PRETTY OBVIOUS FROM ALL THE OTHER INFORMATION/TAKEN FOR GRANTED? IT IS CORRECT RIGHT??} 
Chromic materials are again subdivided into categories dependent on what triggers their optical change. 
For example, photochromic and eletrochromic materials are two categories of chromic materials 
that changes their optical properties when subject to irradiation by light (photons) or an applied 
electric field, respectively. However, another subcategory is thermochromic materials and will be the
category of interest in this assignment
\cite{BookMott1974}. %this is a book I haven't checked yet!
%<-(\cite{Kiri2010},1).
\\
\\
%''Thermos'' is the greek word for warm or hot and thermochromic materials change their optical
%properties (like color) in response to temperature changes
%(\cite{Kamalisarvestani2013},74,75). 
%The word thermochromic, compared to the ''parent'' material class, includes the extra word 
''Thermos'' is the greek word for warm or hot. 
As the name suggests, thermochromic materials change their optical
properties, such as color, in response to heat or, in other words, the change in temperature.
%Thermochromic materials change their optical
%properties (like color) in response to temperature changes

Typically, this change in color happens gradually over a range of temperatures. In this case it is called
continuous thermochromism. Discontinuous thermochromism also occurs and involves a structural
phase change at a certain characteristic ''transition temperature'' $T_t$. This phase
change can be of first or second-order in nature, and may be reversible or irreversible 
\cite{BookMott1974}%(\cite{Kiri2010}:(1)). 
\\
\\
%Compounds like inorganic oxides, liquid cryctals (\cite{Kiri2010}:(2)), 
%conjugated oligomers (\cite{Kiri2010}:(3)), leuco dyes (\cite{Kiri2010}:(4)) can exhibit thermochromic 
%color changes reversibly. Thermochromic dyes however are usually based on organic 
%compounds and show color changes on heating which are not reversible.
Compounds like inorganic oxides, liquid cryctals \cite{Seredyuk2006}%<-(\cite{Kiri2010}:(2)) 
conjugated oligomers, leuco dyes \cite{Seeboth2007} can exhibit thermochromic 
color changes reversibly, while thermochromic dyes, usually based on organic 
compounds, show color temperature dependent changes which are not reversible \cite{Kiri2010}.
\\
\\
To explain the process behind the chromic behaviour, assume that the thermochromic material is initially 
in its cold state called the monoclinic state . 
Here it behaves as a semiconductor, being less reflective especially in the near-infrared(IR) region. 
Heating the material to a certain temperature, known as the transition temperature, 
will make it change from the monoclinic state to a 
rutile state. In the rutile or hot state the material acts like a semi-metal, reflecting 
a wide range of solar radiation. This change of state is called metal-to-semiconductor
transition (MST) \cite[p.~4565]{Blackman2009} and is fully reversible 
and co-occures with large variations in both electrical and optical properties in the near-IR range 
\cite{Morin1959}. 
\\
Because of these interesting properties, thermochromic materials have become increasingly important,
espacially through the use as ''smart coatings''.
Some potential thin film candidates for smart windows include substances such as
Fe$_3$O$_4$, FeSi$_4$, NbO$_2$, NiS, TiO$_2$ and VO$_2$. \cite{White1999}.

\subsection{Thermochromic windows}
A thermochromic window, is a window
with a thermochromic glazing, allowing the window as a whole to adopt the 
optical properties of the thermochromic material. Figure \ref{fig:TCcoating} is a pictorial representation
of the influence of the thermochromic coating on the window. 
%

   \caption{Schematic representation of thermochromic materials applied as an 
   intelligent window coating \cite{Kiri2010}.
   }
   \label{fig:TCcoating}
\end{figure}
%
%Assuming that the transition temperature will $T_t$ of the material is set to the 
%thermal comfort temperature, then any temperature $T$ such that $T>T_t$ will 
Below the transition temperature $T<T_t$, the window should transmit the solar thermal radiation, heating 
up the interior of the building. If the temperature increases above the transition temperature $T_t$,
the transmission of the thermal radiation should decrease significantly, lowering or removing
the necessity of using cooling devices. 
For this to work, the transition temperature, which for most materials is significantly higher 
than room temperature, needs to be reduced down to a thermally comfortable level. 
Similarly to the transmission of the coating, this may be solved through doping with a foreign
material or dopant. An example of such a dopant will be discussed in Section \ref{sec:vo2},
which contains a closer look at a promosing thermochromic coating candidate called vanadium dioxide.
%This can be done by adding small quantities of a foreign material into the thermochromic 
%material, a process called doping.

   }
   \label{fig:idealTCW}
\end{figure}
The ideal spectral modulation of the thermochromic coating is given in Figure \ref{fig:idealTCW}.
This shows how the cold state should transmit the majority of the solar radiation, here modeled
as a black body spectrum. In addition it shows how the hot state should reflect as much 
of the infrared and solar radiation as possible without compromising the transmission of the 
visible spectrum. If the transmission of daylight is poor, it would 
lead to an increase of the electrical load due to the accompanying additional lighting.
\cite{McCluney1996}
\\
\\
As discussed by Blackman \cite[p.~4569]{Blackman2009},
the optical transmission of the film is depending on the thickness of the film. Control of the film
thickness is crucial. Excessive coating thicknesses may lead to too much blocking of the visual light,
leaving the coating unsuitable for architectural application.

For the transmission of visible light to be acceptable it should be higher than 60\%.
%Does this information come from the source of the table of from source ((93,94) Kamalisarvestani)??
The ideal performance of a thermochromic window is shown in Table \ref{tab:idealTCW}, showing 
that the modulation of the spectrum in the visible region should be the same for both the 
monoclinic and rutile state. Notice the transmission of 60\%-65\% of the visible light.

%Also, blackman mentions how the earlier work with VO2 thin films lacked control of film thickness

%optical transmission too low and therefore unsuitable for application in architectural glazing.
